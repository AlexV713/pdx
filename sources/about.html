    <p>Meet Jose and Ana Valerio<br><br>As children in Hidalgo, Mexico, Jose and Ana were friends. Jose sought better job opportunities and moved to the U.S. as a teenager, while Ana stayed in Hidalgo and worked at her mother’s restaurant. It would seem the two would never see each other again, residing thousands of miles apart. When Jose’s grandmother died, he returned home to pay respects. At the services, Ana served barbacoa (lamb slow cooked over an open fire) and the two renewed their friendship. It wasn’t long before they married and Jose introduced Ana to the U.S.<br><br>4 children and a successful business later, the two remain committed to providing the best service to their clients.<br><br>PDX Handyman Services allows Ana and Jose the flexibility to work on projects together while maintaining balance in their family.<br><br>We are happy to share our family’s ventures with you and hope you do the same.
